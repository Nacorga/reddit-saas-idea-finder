# Reddit SaaS Idea Finder

**Reddit SaaS Idea Finder** is a Node.js and TypeScript application designed to discover potential SaaS product ideas from Reddit posts. It achieves this by:

- Accessing the Reddit API using client credentials and renewable access tokens.
- Exploring multiple relevant subreddits in startup, business, and technology domains.
- Analyzing various post categories (`new`, `hot`, `top`, `rising`) within each subreddit.
- Fetching post titles, bodies, and comments to gain deeper insights.
- Identifying keywords (in both English and Spanish) that indicate frustrations, unmet needs, or expensive solutions.
- Performing global keyword searches on Reddit.
- Avoiding reprocessing of the same posts by storing analyzed post IDs.
- Scheduling recurring analyses (e.g., every 6 hours) and adding delays to comply with the Reddit API rate limits.
- Storing results in a `data.json` file for further examination.

## Key Features

- **Multiple Subreddits & Categories:**  
  Broad coverage ensures you find a wide variety of pain points and needs.

- **Bilingual Keywords (English & Spanish):**
